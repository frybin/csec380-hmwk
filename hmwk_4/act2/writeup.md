# How I Got _Jon Doe_ to be Friends With Me

First, after studying the `add_friend.php` script, I noticed that the script took an `id` parameter. This `id` parameter is used as the id of the account you want to friend. After seeing this, I made this link:

> http://csec380-core.csec.rit.edu:84/add_friend.php?id=36

And posted it to the message board. My username:

> oneNutW0nder reee :: id=36
